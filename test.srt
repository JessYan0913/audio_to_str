00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
你好,欢迎来到这个零基础英语学习课程

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
今天是第一课,课程时间大约是一小时

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
你可以在制定的评论区或者说明区下载课件

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
在整个课程中你只需要做三件事情

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
第一,请戴上耳机停,一定要戴耳机

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
第二,每当我问问题的时候,进行思考并尝试回答

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
第三,千万不要用纸和笔来记录

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
好的,我们开始吧

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
第一个词,我用英文应该怎么来说

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
单独一个字母,I

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
那么喜欢,应该怎么说

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
like

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
它中间的这个I,跟刚刚的第一个字母

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I是发音一样的

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
所以把它们两个连接起来

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
我喜欢,应该怎么来表达

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I like

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
这个食物,用英文应该怎么说

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
the food

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
所以把三个连接起来,我喜欢这个食物

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I like the food

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I like the food

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
不的英文

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
don't

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
还记得喜欢怎么说吗

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
like

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
所以不喜欢的说法应该是什么

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
两个连接起来

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
don't like

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
那么这句话,我不喜欢这个食物

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
你可以暂停视频想一想

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I don't like the food

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I don't like the food

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
英文中做的说法

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
to do

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
那么它以及这件事情

38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
在英文中用一个非常简单的词

39
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
it

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
it

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
这个代词可以代表任何事情

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
注意这里的it,千万不要发成it

43
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
所以做这件事情应该怎么说

44
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
to do it

45
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
还记得我喜欢怎么说吗

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I like

47
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
那么我喜欢做这件事情

48
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
应该怎么来比较大

49
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
这件事情是it

50
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
做的是to do

51
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
加上我喜欢

52
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I like to do it

53
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:21,000
不喜欢

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
don't like

55
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
所以我不喜欢做这件事情

56
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
应该怎么来说

57
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I don't like to do it

58
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
如何表达现在

59
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
now

60
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
我喜欢现在做这件事情

61
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
在英文中所有表达时间的词

62
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
一般都放在句子的最后

63
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
所以应该是这样

64
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
我喜欢做这件事情,现在

65
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
应该怎么来说呢

66
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I like to do it now

67
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I like to do it now

68
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I like to do it now

69
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
那么我不喜欢现在做这件事情

70
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
应该怎么说呢

71
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
还是一样把现在放到最后

72
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
我不喜欢做这件事情,现在

73
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
应该是

74
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I don't like to do it now

75
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I don't like to do it now

76
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I don't like to do it now

77
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
这里的英文说法是here

78
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
那么在这里是一个短语

79
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
to be here

80
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
还记得我喜欢应该怎么说吗

81

00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
那么我喜欢在这里

83
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I like to be here

84
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I like to be here

85
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000

don't like

88
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
所以我不喜欢在这里应该怎么表达

89
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I don't like to be here

90
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I don't like to be here

92
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
现在

93
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
now

94
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
所以我不喜欢现在在这里

95
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
还是一样放到最后

96
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
我不喜欢在这里现在

97
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I don't like to be here now

98
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I don't like to be here now

99
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I don't like to be here now

100
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
想要

101
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
用一个非常简单的英文词

102
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
want

103
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
还记得做这件事情应该怎么表达吗

104
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
这件事情是一个非常简单的代词

105
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
然后做是to do

106
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
所以应该是

107
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,000
to do it

108
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
那么我想要做这件事情

109
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
应该怎么说呢

110
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
想要刚刚学过的是want

111
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I want to do it

00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I want to do it

today

122
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
那么我今天想要做这件事情

123
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
还是一样的

124
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
今天放到最后

125
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000

130
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I don't want to do it today

131
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000

那么我现在不想做这件事情

133
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
把表达时间的词放在句尾

134
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
然后我不想做这件事情现在

135
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
吃

136
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
在英文中的说法是

00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
to eat

138
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
to eat

139
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
这个食物

140
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
所以吃这个食物的说法就是

141
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
还记得想要怎么说吗

142
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000

所以我想要吃这个食物

144
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
想一想应该怎么说

145
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
现在的说法

146
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
now

147
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
所以我现在想要吃这个食物

148
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
我们先调整语续

149
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
不想的英文说法

150
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
don't want

151
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
那么我现在不想吃这个食物

152
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
我先调整语续

153
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
还记得这里怎么说吗

154
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
here

155
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
在这里是一个短语

156
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
表示存在在这里

157
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
所以我想要在这里

158
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
我们只需要把想要的含义

159
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
翻译出来就可以了

160
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000

161
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
那么我不想在这里

162
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
应该怎么说呢

163
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
只需要加一个否定词不

164
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
每天的英文说法

165
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
前面这个单词

166
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
every是每一个的意思

167
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
day就是天

168
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
白天的含义

169
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
everyday就是每一天

170
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
我想要每天在这里

171
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
还是一样

172
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
每天是描述一个时间的词

173
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
所以把它放在最后

174
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
我想要在这里每天

175
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
那么我不想每天在这里

176
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
先调整语续

177
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
然后再加一个否定词

178
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
want to be here every day

179
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
一整天

180
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
应该怎么说啊

181
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
all the day

182
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
all the day

183
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
all the day

184
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
all the 含义就是全部

185
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
一天的全部就是一整天

186
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
所以我不想一整天在这里

187
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
先把时间放在后面

188
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
我不想在这里一整天

189
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
所以是

190
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
需要

191
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
有英文怎么说呢

192
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
在这里

193
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
有英文应该怎么来说

194
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
所以我需要在这里

195
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I need to be here

196
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
那么我不需要在这里

197
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
只需要加一个否定词

198
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
还记得每天应该怎么说吗

199
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
every day

200
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
我需要每天在这里

201
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
调整语续

202
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
然后逐个翻译

203
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I need to be here every day

204
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I need to be here every day

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I need to be here every day

206
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
那么我不需要每天在这里

207
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
还是一样

208
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
然后再加一个否定词

209
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
所以吃这个食物应该怎么来讲

210
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
这个食物是

211
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000

我现在需要吃这个食物

216
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
我们先把时间词

217
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
调整一下

218
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
所以是

219
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I need to eat the food now

220
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000

它这件事情应该怎么来表达

228
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000

00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:48,000
important

393
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
所以重要的某些事情

394
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
应该怎么说呢

395
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
注意在描述

396
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
但某的这个名词的时候

397
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
这个

398
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
像重要的

399
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
其他什么什么的的形式

400
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
都要放在这个某的后面

401
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
就变成某些事情重要的

402
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
所以应该是

403
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
所以我需要告诉你

404
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
某些事情

405
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
应该是

406
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I need to tell you

407
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
something

408
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
I need to tell you

409
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
something

410
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
那么我需要告诉你

411
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
重要的某些事情

412
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
应该怎么说呢

413
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
记住这个是需要变换一下语绪的

414
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I need to tell you

415
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
something important

416
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I need to tell you

417
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
something important

418
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I need to tell you

419
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
something important

420
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
还记得他这件事情的带词的吗

421
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
那么如何说

422
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
他是重要的

423
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
这个重要的我们刚刚说过

424
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
叫做important

425
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
这个他呢是it

426
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
只需要再加一个连接词

427
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
就可以了

428
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
所以是

429
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
it is important

430
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
it is important

431
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
非常的英文说法是

432
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
very

433
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
very

434
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
所以他是非常重要的

435
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
只需要把他们都连起来

436
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
it is very important

437
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,000
it is very important

438
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
it is very important

439
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
我的另外一种说法

440
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
前面我们学过了I

441
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
他还有另外一种叫做

442
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,000
me

443
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
对我来说

444
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
在英文中只需要两个词叫做

445
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,000
for me

446
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
这个for

447
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
略读的说叫做for

448
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:48,000
他的意思是为了对什么什么来说

449
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,000
所以他是重要的对我来说

450
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
应该怎么翻译

451
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
it is important

452
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
for me

453
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
it is important

454
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
for me

455
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
it is important for me

456
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
他是非常重要的对我来说

457
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
只需要加上一个非常就可以了

458
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
it is very important

459
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
for me

460
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
it is very important

461
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
for me

462
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
it is very important

463
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
还记得做这件事情应该怎么说吗

464
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,000
to do it

465
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
做这件事情它是重要的

466
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
这句话应该怎么说呢

467
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
首先我们来看一下汉语的意思

468
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
是说做这件事情

469
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
把它看作一个整体

470
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
用它来带指

471
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
是重要的

472
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
所以需要把做这件事情放到最后面

473
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
然后逐个翻译

474
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
他就是it

475
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
是 is

476
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
重要的important

477
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
做这件事情呢

478
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
to do it

479
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
所以答案就是

480
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
it is important

481
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
to do it

482
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
it is important

483
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
to do it

484
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
还记不记得在这里来到这里怎么说

485
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
to be here

486
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,000
那么来到这里

487
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
它是重要的

488
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
来到这里这件事它是重要的

489
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
我们首先把它拖到最后面

490
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
它是重要的来到这里

491
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
应该怎么来翻译

492
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
首先

493
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
这个它就是it

494
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
是 is

495
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
重要的

496
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
important

497
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
来到这里

498
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
to be here

499
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
所以这句话应该这么说

500
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
it is important

501
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
to be here

502
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
it is important

503
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
to be here

504
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
it is important to be here

505
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
吃这个食物怎么说来着

506
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
to eat the food

507
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,000
to eat the food

508
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,000
那么吃这个食物它是重要的

509
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
应该怎么来说

510
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
首先我们来调整一下语绪

511
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
因为这个它代表的就是吃这个食物

512
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
这一整个整体

513
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
所以我们把它拖到最后

514
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,000
首先它是重要的去吃这个食物

515
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
所以应该是

516
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
it is important

517
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
to eat the food

518
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
it is important

519
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
to eat the food

520
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
it is important to eat the food

521
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
不可能的用英文怎么说

522
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
impossible

523
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
impossible

524
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
impossible

525
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
那么它是不可能的

526
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
应该怎么来翻译

527
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:52,000
it is impossible

528
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
还记不记得做这件事情怎么说

529
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:04,000
to do it

530
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
那么做这件事情它是不可能的

531
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
应该怎么说

532
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
首先这个代词的词应该放到最前面

533
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
然后把这件事情做这件事情放到最后

534
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:22,000
它是不可能的去做这件事情

535
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,000
it is impossible to do it

536
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,000
it is impossible to do it

537
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
it is impossible to do it

538
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,000
那么现在做这件事情它是不可能的

539
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
我们首先把这个

540
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,000
它所代词的内容全都放在后面

541
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
然后发现这个有一个时间

542
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
描述时间的词

543
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
同样拖到最后

544
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
所以应该这么来讲

545
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:06,000
it is impossible to do it

546
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
now

547
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:13,000
it is impossible to do it now

548
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,000
it is impossible to do it now

549
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
还记得对我来说的英语是什么吗

550
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:31,000
for me

551
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,000
它是不可能的对我来说

552
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:43,000
it is impossible for me

553
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:48,000
it is impossible for me

554
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,000
好的非常棒的

555
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:57,000
这个词叫做 good

556
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
good

557
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,000
所以它是好的应该怎么说

558
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:12,000
it is good

559
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
还记得在这里来到这里的说法吗

560
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:24,000
to be here

561
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,000
那么来到这里它是好的

562
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
首先来调整语序

563
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
把带子的词放到最后

564
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
把这个它的带子放到最前面

565
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
它是好的来到这里

566
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:51,000
it is good to be here

567
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
那么来到这里它是非常好的

568
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
还是一样拖到最后

569
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
然后加上一个非常这个词

570
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:17,000
it is very good to be here

571
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,000
见到你用英文怎么来表达

572
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:28,000
to see you

573
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
那么见到你是非常好的

574
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
把这个拖到最后

575
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:51,000
it is very good to see you

576
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
还记得每天应该怎么说吗

577
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
every day

578
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
每天

579
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
每天见到你它是非常好的

580
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
好 现在要调整被这个带子

581
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
它所代表的这一整句话放到最后

582
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
然后我们发现还有一个表示时间的词

583
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
再把它拖到最后

584
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
所以应该这么说

585
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,000
it is very good to see you

586
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:37,000
every day

587
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
可能的用英文怎么说

588
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:49,000
possible

589
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
所以它是可能的

590
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:03,000
it is possible

591
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
见到你

592
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:14,000
to see you

593
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,000
所以见到你它是可能的

594
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
见到你这件事情它是可能的

595
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
所以把见到你放到最后

596
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
把这个带子放到最前面

597
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:41,000
it is possible to see you

598
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
每天怎么说来着

599
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,000
every day

600
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
每天见到你它是可能的

601
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
首先把带子所代替的这一整句话

602
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
全都放到最后

603
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
然后把时间的词再往后拖

604
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
变成它是可能的见到你每天

605
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:17,000
it is possible to see you every day

606
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
it is possible to see you every day

607
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
不可能的用英文怎么说来着

608
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:32,000
impossible

609
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
所以每天见到你它是不可能的

610
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
应该怎么说

611
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
很简单只需要改动是一个词就可以了

612
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
但是我们还是从调整语序开始

613
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,000
先把带子所代表的一整句话拖到最后

614
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,000
然后把时间的词再放到最后

615
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
它就变成了

616
00:47:52,000 --> 00:48:07,000
it is impossible to see you every day

617
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
知道认识的用文说法是

618
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,000
to know

619
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
那么我想要知道

620
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:25,000
I want to know

621
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
是否

622
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
简单的两个字吗

623
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:37,000
if

624
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:42,000
所以我想要知道是否它是可能的

625
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
你可以暂停视频

626
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
然后一个词一个词的来翻译

627
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I want to know if it is possible

628
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:02,000
I want to know if it is possible

629
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
I want to know if it is possible

630
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
它是重要的

631
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
应该怎么说

632
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:22,000
it is important

633
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
我想知道是否它是重要的

634
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:33,000
I want to know if it is important

635
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:40,000
I want to know if it is important

636
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
I want to know if it is important

637
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
还记不记得对我来说应该怎么来表达

638
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
所以它是非常重要的对我来说

639
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
应该怎么说呢

640
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:09,000
it is very important for me

641
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
it is very important for me

642
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
还记得必须做用英文怎么说吗

643
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
那么我必须做这件事情

644
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:38,000
I have to do it

645
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,000
我今天必须做这件事情

646
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,000
把时间词放在最后

647
00:50:51,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I have to do it today

648
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
所以的英文说法是

649
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
so

650
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
好接下来有一个长句

651
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
它是重要的对我来说

652
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
所以我必须做这件事情

653
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
暂停视频

654
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
然后一个词一个词的来翻译

655
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,000
it is important for me

656
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:41,000
so I have to do it

657
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
它是重要的对我来说

658
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
所以我今天必须做这件事情

659
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:05,000
还是一样看到时间词都要把它放在最后

660
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
所以这句话的说法是

661
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
还记得每天的说法吗

662
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:41,000
它是重要的对我来说

663
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
所以我必须每天做这件事情

664
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
还是一样先把时间词拉到最后

665
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
it is important for me

666
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,000
so I have to do it everyday

667
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,000
it is important for me

668
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,000
so I have to do it everyday

669
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
it is important for me

670
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
so I have to do it everyday

671
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
还记得非常的说法吗

672
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,000
所以它是非常重要的对我来说

673
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
所以我必须每天做这件事情

674
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
看到每天就把它放到最后

675
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
这句话需要多加一个

676
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
非常地词就可以了

677
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:44,000
it is very important for me

678
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:49,000
so I have to do it everyday

679
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:55,000
it is very important for me

680
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:00,000
so I have to do it everyday

681
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
it is very important for me

682
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
so I have to do it everyday

683
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
还记得现在的说法吗

684
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
它是非常重要的对我来说

685
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
所以我必须现在做这件事情

686
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
把现在放到最后

687
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
然后逐个翻译就可以了

688
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:29,000
it is very important for me

689
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:34,000
so I have to do it now

690
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:39,000
it is very important for me

691
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,000
so I have to do it now

692
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
it is very important for me

693
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
so I have to do it now

694
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
不重要的应该怎么说呢

695
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,000
not important

696
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:03,000
not important

697
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,000
只需要在重要前面加一个not就可以了

698
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,000
所以它是不重要的

699
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,000
it is not important

700
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,000
it is not important

701
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000

702
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
它是不重要的对我来说

703
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:37,000
it is not important for me

704
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:46,000
it is not important for me

705
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
还记得不必做的说法吗

706
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:56,000
don't have to do

707
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:03,000
所以我不必做这件事情的说法就是

708
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
还记得现在怎么说吗

709
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:23,000
now

710
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
那么我现在不必做这件事情

711
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,000
现在拖到最后

712
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:35,000
I don't have to do it now

713
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,000
I don't have to do it now

714
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
I don't have to do it now

715
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
还记得所以怎么说吗

716
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:53,000
so

717
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
它是不重要的对我来说

718
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:59,000
所以我不必现在做这件事情

719
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
把时间词拖到最后

720
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
然后主个翻译

721
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:11,000
it is not important for me

722
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:16,000
so I don't have to do it now

723
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:21,000
it is not important for me

724
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,000
so I don't have to do it now

725
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
it is not important for me

726
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
so I don't have to do it now

727
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
我喜欢吃这个食物

728
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,000
I like to eat the food

729
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,000
I like to eat the food

730
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
I like to eat the food

731
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:53,000
那么我今天想要做这件事情的英文说法是

732
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:59,000
首先把今天的这个时间词放到最后

733
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:09,000
I want to do it today

734
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:14,000
I want to do it today

735
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
I want to do it today

736
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,000
我需要告诉你重要的某些事情

737
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:33,000
I need to tell you something important

738
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:40,000
I need to tell you something important

739
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
I need to tell you something important

740
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
我必须尽快认识你

741
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,000
因为这个尽快也是一个时间词

742
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
所以我们把它放在后面

743
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,000
所以这句话的英文说法是

744
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:02,000
I have to know you soon

745
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:08,000
I have to know you soon

746
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
I have to know you soon

747
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,000
来到这里它是好的它是棒的

748
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:19,000
首先把这个它所代表的整段拉到最后

749
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
所以这句话的英文是

750
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:27,000
It is good to be here

751
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:33,000
It is good to be here

752
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,000
It is good to be here

753
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,000
它是非常重要的对我来说

754
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
现在做这件事情它是不可能的

755
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:16,000
It is impossible to do it now

756
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,000
It is impossible to do it now

757
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
