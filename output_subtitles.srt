进行思考并尝试回答

14
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,640

00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,480
我

20
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,080

00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,280
爱

23
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,040
单独一个字母

24
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,000
爱

25
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,840
那么喜欢

26
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,720

27
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,680

爱

32
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,080
跟刚刚的

33
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,480
第一个字母

34
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,880
爱是翻一样的

35
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,040
所以把他们两个连接起来

36
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,280
我喜欢

37
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,680
应该怎么来表达

38
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,800

41
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,760

00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,760
该怎么说

43
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,680

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,000
the food

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,240

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,760
the food

47
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,920
所以把三个连接起来

48
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,320
我喜欢这个十五

49
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,560
I like the food

like

59
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,360
所以不喜欢的说法应该是什么

60
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,600
两个连接起来

61
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,880
don't like

62
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,200
don't like

63
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,800
don't like

64
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,280
那么这句话

65
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,840
我不喜欢这个十五

66
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,720
你可以暂停视频想一想

67
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,200
I don't like the food

68
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,480
I don't like the food

69
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,720
I don't like the food

70
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,440
因为中做了的说法

71
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
to do

72
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,600

to do

74
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,280
那么他以及之间事情

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,720
在英文中用一个非常简单的词

76
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,960

00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,960

79
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,160
这个代词可以代表任何事情

80
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,440
注意这里的at

81
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,440
千万不要发辰at

82
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,800
是at

83
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,800
所以做这件事情应该怎么说

84
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,800
to do it

85
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,800

92
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,760
这件事情应该怎么来比较大

93
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,760

I like to do it

101
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,760
不喜欢

102
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,760
Don't like

Don't like

105
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,760
所以我不喜欢做这件事情应该怎么来说

106
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,760
I don't like

107
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,760
to do it

108
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,760
I don't like

109
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,760

I don't like to do it

111
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,760
如何表达现在

112
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,760
Now

113
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,760
Now

114
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,760
Now

115
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,760
我喜欢现在做这件事情

116
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,760
在英文中所有表达时间的词

117
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,760
一般都放在

118
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,760
剧子的最后

119
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,760
所以应该是这样

120
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,760
我喜欢做这件事情现在

121
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,760
应该怎么来说呢

122
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,760
I like to do it

123
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,760

I like to do it

125
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,760
Now

126
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,760
I like to do it now

127
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,760
那么我不喜欢

128
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,760
现在做这件事情应该怎么说呢

129
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,760
还是一样把现在放到最后

130
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,760
我不喜欢做这件事情现在

131
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,760
应该是

132
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,760
I don't like

133
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,760

134
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:00,760
I don't like to do it now

135
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,760
I don't like to do it now

136
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,760

138
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,760

Here

140
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,760
那么在这里

141
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,760
是一个短语

142
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,760
to be here

143
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,760
to be here

144
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,760

I like to be here

152
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,760
I like to be here

153
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,760
还记得不喜欢怎么说吗

154
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:02,760
Don't like

155
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,760
Don't like

156
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,760
Don't like

157
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,760
所以我不喜欢在这里应该怎么表达啊

158
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:18,760
I don't like to be here

159
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,760
I don't like to be here

160
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,760
I don't like to be here

161
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,760
现在

162
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,760
Now

163
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,760
Now

164
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,760
所以我不喜欢现在在这里

165
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,760
还是一样放到最后

166
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,760
我不喜欢在这里现在

167
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:52,760
I don't like to be here now

168
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:57,760

想要

171
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,760
因为非常简单的英文说

172
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,760
Want

173
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,760
还记得做这件事情应该怎么

174
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,760
来表达吗

175
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,760
这件事情是一个非常简单的代字

176
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,760
然后做事

177
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,760
to do

178
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,760
所以应该是

00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,760
to do it

180
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,760
to do it

Don't want

188
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,760
Don't want

189
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,760
所以我不想做这件事情就很简单了

190
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:14,760
I don't want to do it

191
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,760

Today

196
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,760
那么我今天想要做这件事情

197
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,760
还是一样的

198
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,760
今天放到最后

199
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,760

203
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,760
我今天不想做这件事情

204
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,760
还是一样很简单放到最后

205
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,760
然后加上一个步

206
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:11,760
I don't want to do it today

207
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:17,760
I don't want to do it today

208
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,760
I don't want to do it today

209
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,760
还记得现在怎么说吗

210
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,760
Now

211
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,760
Now

212
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,760
那么我现在不想做这件事情

213
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,760
把表达时间的词放在具围

214
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,760
然后我不想做这件事情现在

215
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:46,760
I don't want to do it now

216
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:51,760
I don't want to do it now

217
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,760
I don't want to do it now

218
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,760
吃

219
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,760
在英文中的说法是

220
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,760
to eat

221
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,760
to eat

222
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,760
这个食物

223
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,760
the food

224
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,760
所以吃这个食物的说法就是

225
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:23,760
to eat the food

226
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,760

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,760
现在的说法

236
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:06,760
Now

237
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,760
所以我现在想要吃这个食物

238
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,760
我们先调整预讯

239
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,760

240
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,760

那么我现在不想吃这个食物

245
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,760
我先调整预讯

246
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:48,760
I don't want to eat the food now

247
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:54,760
I don't want to eat the food now

248
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,760
I don't want to eat the food now

249

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,760
我们只需要把想要的含义

翻译出来就可以了

257
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,760

00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,760
那么我不想在这里

261
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,760
应该怎么说呢

262
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,760
只需要加一个否定词步

263
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,760
I don't want to be here

264
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,760
I don't want to be here

265
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,760
I don't want to be here

266
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,760
每天都用这说法

267
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,760
Every day

268
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,760
前面这个单试

269
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,760
Every day

270
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,760
是每一个的意思

271
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,760
day就是天

272
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,760
白天的含义

273
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:22,760
Every day就是每一天

274
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,760
我想要每天在这里

275
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,760
还是一样每天是描述一个时间的词

276
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,760
所以把它放在最后

277
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,760
我想要在这里每天

278
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,760
I want to be here

279
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,760

I want to be here every day

283
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,760
那么我不想每天在这里

284
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,760
先调中语续然后再加一个否定词

285
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:02,760
I don't want to be here every day

286
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:07,760
I don't want to be here every day

287

288
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,760
一整天

289
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,760
应该怎么说

290
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,760
All the day

291
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,760
All the day

292
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,760
All the day

293
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,760
All the含义就是全部

294
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,760
一天的全部就是一整天

295
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,760
所以我不想一整天在这里

296
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,760
先把时间放在后面

297
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,760
我不想在这里一整天

298
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,760
所以是

299
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:46,760
I don't want to be here all the day

300
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:52,760
I don't want to be here all the day

301
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:56,760
I don't want to be here all the day

302
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,760
需要语续怎么说呢

00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,760
你的

00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,760
你的

305
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,760
你的

306
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,760
在这里

307
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,760
因为我应该怎么来说

308
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,760
to be here

309
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,760
to be here

310
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,760

I need to be here

314
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,760
I need to be here

315
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,760
那么我不需要在这里

316
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,760
只需要加一个否定词

317
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,760
I don't need to be here

318
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,760
I don't need to be here

319
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,760
I don't need to be here

320
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,760
还记得每天应该怎么说吗

321
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,760
Every day

322
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,760
Every day

323
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,760
Every day

324
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,760
我需要每天在这里

325
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,760
调中语续

326
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,760
然后诸个翻译

327
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,760
I need to be here every day

328
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:23,760
I need to be here every day

329
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,760
I need to be here every day

330
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,760
那么我不需要每天在这里

331
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,760
还是一样

332
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,760
然后加一个否定词

333
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:40,760
I don't need to be here every day

334
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:46,760
I don't need to be here every day

335
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:51,760
I don't need to be here every day

336
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,760
所以吃这个食物应该怎么讲

337
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,760
这个食物是

338
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,760
the food

339
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,760
吃吃it

340
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,760
这eet

341
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,760
那么把它们都合起来

342
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,760
to eat the food

343
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,760
to eat the food

344
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,760
to eat the food

345
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,760
所以我需要吃这个食物

346
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:25,760
I need to eat the food

347
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,760
I need to eat the food

348
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,760
I need to eat the food

349
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,760
还记得现在也该怎么说吗

350
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,760
Now

351
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,760
Now

352
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,760
我现在需要吃这个食物

353
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,760
我们先把时间词

354
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,760
调整一下

355
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,760
所以是

356
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,760
I need to eat the food

357
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,760
Now

358
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,760
I need to eat the food

359
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,760
Now

360
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,760
I need to eat the food

361
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,760
我现在不需要吃这个食物

362
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,760
调整时间词

363
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,760
然后给它添加一个否定

364
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,760
I don't need to eat the food

365
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,760
Now

366
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:26,760
I don't need to eat the food

367
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,760
Now

368
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,760
I don't need to eat the food

369
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,760
Now

370
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,760
还记得这个最简单的意思

371
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,760
它这件事情应该怎么来表达

372
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,760
it

373
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,760
it

374
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,760
it

375
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,760
it

376
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,760
做

377
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,760
to do

378
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,760
to do

379
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,760
to do

380
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,760
所以做这件事情就是

381
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,760
to do it

382
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,760
to do it

383
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,760
to do it

384
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,760
那么我需要做这件事情应该怎么说呢

385
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,760
I need to do it

386
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,760
I need to do it

387
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,760
I need to do it

388
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,760
还记得今天的说法吗

389
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,760
Today

390
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,760
Today

391
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,760
Today

392
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:35,760
那么我今天需要做这件事情

393
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,760
放到后面

394
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,760
再加一个否定

395
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,760
所以应该怎么说呢

396
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,760

00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,760
something

594
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,760
I need to tell you something

595
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,760
那么我需要告诉你

596
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,760
重要的某些事情

597
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,760
怎么说呢

598
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,760
记住这个是需要变换一下预许的

599
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,760
I need to tell you

600
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,760
something

601
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,760
important

602
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,760
I need to tell you

603
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,760
something

604
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,760
I need to tell you

605
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,760
something

606
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,760
important

607
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,760
还记得它

608
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,760
这里事情这个代词的吗

609
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,760
it

610
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,760
it

611
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,760
那么如何说它是重要的

612
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,760
这个重要的

613
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,760
刚刚说过叫做

614
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,760
important

615
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,760
它是it

616
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,760
只需要再加一个连接词

617
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,760
是就可以了

618
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,760
这个重要的词

619
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,760
是重要的

620
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,760
这个重要的词

621
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,760
是重要的

622
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,760
非常地用文说法是

623
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,760
very

624
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,760
very

625
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,760
very

626
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,760
所以它是非常重要的

627
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,760
只需要把他们都联起来

628
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,760
it

629
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,760
is

630
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,760
very

631
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,760
important

632
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,760
it

633
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,760
is

634
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,760
very

635
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,760
important

636
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,760
我

637
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,760
的另外一种说法

638
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,760
前面我们学过了爱

639
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,760
它还有另外一种叫做

640
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,760
me

641
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,760
me

642
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,760
对我来说

643
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,760
在英文中只需要两个词叫做

644
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,760
for me

645
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,760
for me

646
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,760
for me

647
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,760
for me

648
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,760
for

649
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,760
绿毒的试叫做for

650
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,760
它是的意思是为了

651
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,760
对什么什么来说

652
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,760
所以

653
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,760
它是重要的

654
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,760
对我来说应该怎么翻译

655
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,760
it

656
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,760
is

657
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,760
important

658
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,760
for me

659
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,760
it

660
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,760
is

661
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,760
important

662
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,760
for me

663
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,760
它是非常重要的对我来说

664
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,760
只需要加上一个非常就可以了

665
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,760
it

666
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,760
is

667
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,760
very

668
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,760
important

669
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,760
for me

670
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,760
it

671
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,760
is

672
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,760
for me

673
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,760
做这件事情怎么说

674
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,760
to do

675
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,760
it

676
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,760
to do

677
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,760
做这件事情它是重要的

678
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,760
这句话应该怎么说呢

679
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,760
首先我们来看一下

680
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,760
焊语的意思

681
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,760
是说做这件事情

682
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,760
把它看作一个整体

683
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,760
用它

684
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,760
来带制

685
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,760
是重要的

686
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,760
所以需要把做这件事情放到最后面

687
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,760
然后

688
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,760
主教翻译

689
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,760
it

690
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,760
is

691
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,760
重要的

692
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,760
important

693
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,760
做这件事情呢

694
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,760
to do

695
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,760
it

696
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,760
所以大家就是

697
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,760
it

698
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,760
is

699
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,760
important

700
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,760
to do

701
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,760
it

702
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,760
is

703
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,760
important

704
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,760
在这里来到这里怎么说

705
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,760
to be here

706
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,760
to be here

707
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,760
to be here

708
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,760
那么

709
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,760
it

710
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,760
is

711
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,760
重要的

712
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,760
it

713
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,760
is

714
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,760
重要的

715
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,760
important

716
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,760
来到这里

717
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,760
to be here

718
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,760
so

719
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,760
这句话应该这么说

720
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,760
it

721
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,760
is

722
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,760
重要的

723
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,760
所以这句话应该这么说

724
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,760
it

725
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,760
is

726
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,760
important

727
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,760
to be here

728
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,760
it

729
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,760
is

730
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,760
important

731
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,760
to be here

732
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,760
吃这个食物

733
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,760
怎么说来就好

734
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,760
to eat

735
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,760
the food

736
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,760
to eat

737
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,760
the food

738
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,760
那么吃这个食物

739
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,760
它是重要的

740
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,760
应该怎么来说

741
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,760
首先我们来调整一下语句

742
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,760
因为这个它代表的就是

743
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,760
吃这个食物

744
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,760
这一整个整体

745
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,760
所以我们把它拖到最后

746
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,760
首先它是重要的

747
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,760
去吃这个食物

748
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,760
所以应该是

749
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,760
it

750
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,760
is

751
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,760
important

752
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,760
to eat the food

753
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,760
it is

754
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,760
important

755
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,760
to eat the food

756
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,760
it is

757
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,760
important

758
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,760
to eat the food

759
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,760
不可能的

760
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,760
用言文怎么说

761
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,760
impossible

762
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,760
impossible

763
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,760
impossible

764
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:38,760
那么它是不可能的

765
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,760
应该怎么来翻译

766
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,760
it is

767
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,760
impossible

768
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,760
impossible

769
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,760
impossible

770
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:54,760
还记不记得做这件事情怎么说

771
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:58,760
to do it

772
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:02,760
to do it

773
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,760
to do it

774
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,760
那么做这件事情

775
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,760
它是不可能的

776
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,760
应该怎么说

777
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,760
首先这个代质的词

778
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,760
应该放到最前面

779
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,760
然后把这件

780
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,760
做这件事情

781
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,760
放到最后

782
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,760
它是不可能的

783
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,760
去做这件事情

784
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,760
it is

785
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,760
impossible

786
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,760
to do it

787
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,760
it is

788
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,760
impossible

789
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,760
to do it

790
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,760
那么现在做这件事情

791
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,760
它是不可能的

792
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,760
我们首先把这个

793
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,760
它所代质的内容全都放在后面

794
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,760
然后发现这个有一个时间

795
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,760
描述时间的词

796
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,760
同样拖到最后

797
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,760
所以应该这么来讲

798
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,760
it is

799
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,760
impossible

800
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,760
to do it

801
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,760
now

802
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,760
it is

803
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,760
impossible

804
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,760
to do it

805
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,760
now

806
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,760
it is

807
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,760
impossible

808
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,760
还记得对我来说

809
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,760

810
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,760

811
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,760
for me

812
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,760
for me

813
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,760
它是不可能的

814
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,760
对我来说

815
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,760
it is

816
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,760
impossible

817
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,760
for me

818
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,760
it is

819
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,760
impossible

820
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,760
for me

821
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,760
好的

822
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,760
非常棒的

823
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,760
这个词叫做

824
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,760
good

825
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,760
good

826
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,760
所以它是好的

827
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,760
应该这么说

828
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,760
it is

829
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,760
good

830
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,760
it is

831
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,760

832
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,760
还记得在这里

833
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,760
来到这里的说法吗

00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:18,760

835
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,760
to be here

836
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,760
to be here

837
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:26,760
那么来到这里它是好的

838
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,760
首先调整语续

839
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:32,760
把代质的词放到最后

840
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,760
把这个它的代词放到最前面

841
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,760
它是好的

842
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,760
来到这里

843
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,760
it is good

844
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,760
to be here

845
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,760
it is good

846
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,760
to be here

847
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,760
it is good to be here

848
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,760
那么来到这里它是非常好的

849
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,760
还是一样

850
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,760
拖到最后

851
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,760
然后加上一个非常

852
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,760
这个词

853
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:08,760
it is very good to be here

854
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:12,760
it is very good to be here

855
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:16,760
it is very good to be here

856
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:20,760
见到你

857
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,760
拥有问题怎么来表达

858
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,760
to see you

859
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,760
to see you

860
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,760
to see you

861
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,760
那么见到你

862
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,760
是非常好的

863
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:36,760
把这个拖到最后

864
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:44,760
it is very good to see you

865
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:48,760
it is very good to see you

866
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,760
it is very good to see you

867
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:54,760
还记得每天应该怎么说吗

868
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:58,760
every day

869
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:02,760
every day

870
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,760
每天见到你

871
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,760
它是非常好的

872
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:08,760
现在要调整

873
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:12,760
被这个代词它所代表的这一整句话

874
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,760
放到最后

875
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,760
然后我们发现还有一个表示时间的词

876
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,760
再把它拖到最后

877
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,760
所以

878
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,760
应该这么说

879
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:26,760
it is very good to see you

880
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,760
every day

881
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:32,760
it is very good to see you

882
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,760
every day

883
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,760
it is very good to see you

884
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,760
every day

885
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,760
可能呢用用用用怎么说

886
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,760
Possible

887
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,760
Possible

888
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:48,760
Possible

889
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:52,760
所以它是可能的

890
00:45:52,760 --> 00:46:04,320
It is possible.

891
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:08,380
见到你,

892
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:15,520
to see you.

893
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:19,640
所以见到你,他是可能的.

894
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:26,640
所以把见到你,放到最后,把这个带词放到之前面。

895
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:35,640
It is possible to see you.

896
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:42,640
It is possible to see you.

897
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,640
每天怎么说来着?

898
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:50,640
Every day, every day, every day.

899
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,640
每天见到你,他是可能的。

900
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:58,640
首先把带词所代替的这一一整句话,全都放到最后,

901
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:02,640
然后把时间的词再往后多,

902
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:06,640
变成他是可能的,见到你每天。

903
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:11,640
It is possible to see you every day.

904
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:17,640
It is possible to see you every day.

905
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:20,640
It is possible to see you every day.

906
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:26,640
Impossible.

907
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:32,640
Impossible.

908
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,640
所以每天见到你,他是不可能的。

909
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:39,640
应该怎么说,很简单,只需要改动自己一次就可以的。

910
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:42,840
但是我们还是从调整语句开始

911
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:45,840
先把带词所代表的一整句话

912
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:46,640
拖到最后

913
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:50,040
然后把时间的词再放到最后

914
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,040
它就变成了

915
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:57,840
It is impossible to see you every day

916
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:03,440
It is impossible to see you every day

917
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,640
It is impossible to see you every day

918
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:10,640
知道认识的英文说法是

919
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:15,640
To know

920
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:18,640
那么我想要知道

921
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:23,640
I want to know

922
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:27,640
I want to know

923
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:30,640

简单的两个字母

925
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:32,640
If

926
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,640
If

927
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:35,640
If

928
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:39,640
所以我想要知道

929
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:41,640
是否它是可能的

930
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:45,640
你可以暂停视频

931
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:47,640
然后一个词一个词的来翻译

932
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:52,640
I want to know

933
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:53,640
If

934
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,640
It is possible

935
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:58,640
I want to know

936
00:48:58,640 --> 00:48:59,640

00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:02,640
It is possible

938
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:06,640
I want to know if it's possible

939
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,640
它是重要的

940
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:11,640
应该怎么说

941
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:15,640
It is important

942
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:19,640
It is important

943
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:22,640
It is important

944
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:27,640
我想知道是否它是重要的

945
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:30,640
I want to know

946
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:34,640
If it is important

947
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,640
I want to know

948
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:40,640
If it is important

949
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,640
I want to know if it's important

950
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:47,640
还记不记得对我来说应该怎么来表达

951
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:52,640
For me

952
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:56,640
所以它是非常重要的对我来说

953
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:03,640
It is very important for me

954
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:09,640
It is very important for me

955
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:13,640
It is very important for me

956
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:18,640
还记得必须做应该怎么说吗

957
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:24,640
Have to do

958
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:30,640
那么我必须做这件事情

959
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:38,640
I have to do it

960
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:42,640
I have to do it

961
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:46,640
我今天必须做这件事情

962
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:51,640
把时间死放在最后

00:50:51,640 --> 00:51:03,640
I have to do it today

964
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:12,640
所以的英文说法是

965
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:13,640
这下来有一句长句

966
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:16,640
它是重要的对我来说

967
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,640
所以我必须做这件事情

968
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:21,640
暂停视频

969
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:26,640
一个词的来翻译

970
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:36,640
It is important for me

971
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:43,640

它是重要的对我来说

977
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:00,640
所以我今天必须做这件事情

978
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:05,640
还是一样看到时间死都要把它放在最后

979
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:07,640
所以这句话的说法是

980
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:10,640
It is important for me

981
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:15,640

00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:31,640
还记得没听到说法吗

它是重要的对我来说

989
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:44,640
所以我必须每天做这件事

00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:49,640
还是一样先把时间死拉到最后

991
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:56,640
It is important for me

992
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:00,640

1004
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:44,640

把现在放到最后

1015
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:23,640

Not important

1026
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:05,640
只需要在重要前面加一个

1027
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:07,640
Not就可以了

1028
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:13,640
所以它是不重要的

1029
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:19,640
It is not important

1030
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:25,640

Don't have to do

1038
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:04,640

I don't have to do it

1040
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:12,640
I don't have to do it

1041
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:16,640
I don't have to do it

1042
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,640
还记得现在怎么说吗

1043
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,640
Now

1044
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,640
Now

1045
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:26,640
那么我现在不必做这件事情

1046
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:30,640
现在拖到最后

1047
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:35,640
I don't have to do it now

1048
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:39,640
I don't have to do it now

1049
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:43,640

还记得所以怎么说吗

1051
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:51,640
So

1052
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:55,640
它是不重要的对我来说

1053
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:59,640
所以我不必现在做这件事情

1054
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:03,640
把时间词拖到最后

1055
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:07,640
然后就给我翻译

1056
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:11,640
It is not important for me

1057
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:15,640
So I don't have to do it now

1058
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:21,640
It is not important for me

1059
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:25,640
So I don't have to do it now

1060
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:27,640
It is not important for me

1061
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:31,640
So I don't have to do it now

1062
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:35,640
喜欢吃这个食物

1063
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:43,640
I like to eat the food

1064
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:47,640
I like to eat the food

1065
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:53,640
那么我今天想要做这件事情的英文手法是

1066
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:59,640
首先把今天的时间词放到最后

1067
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:09,640
I want to do it today

1068
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:15,640
I want to do it today

1069
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:19,640
I want to do it today

1071
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:41,640
I need to tell you something important

1072
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:45,640
I need to tell you something important

1073
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:47,640
我必须尽快认识你

1074
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:49,640
因为这个尽快也是一个时间词

1075
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:53,640
所以我们把它放在后面

1076
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:57,640
所以这句话的英文手法是

1077
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:09,640
I have to know you soon

1078
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:13,640

1080
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:19,640
首先把这个tah所代表的整段拉到最后

1081
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:23,640
这句话的英文手法是

1082
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:27,640
It is good to be here

1083
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:33,640
